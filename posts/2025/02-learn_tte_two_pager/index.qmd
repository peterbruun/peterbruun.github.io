1. Learn causal diagrams / directed acyclic graphs 

The core of TTE is the research question and the required study assumptions required to answer it. Here directed acyclic graphs are a key tool. This helps you identify confounding, and the adjustment sets required to obtain exchangeability (that is, emulate randomization). 

I suggest starting with the free course: Causal Diagrams: Draw You Assumptions Before Your Conclusions, by Miguel Hernan and Harvard. https://pll.harvard.edu/course/causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-your-conclusions  

Learn to use DAGitty 

Drawing DAGs and identifying open backdoor paths (confounding) and colliders can be challenging. Luckily, tools exist that can help you do this automatically. One such tool is DAGitty. DAGitty is a free online-tool which can be found here: https://www.dagitty.net/dags.html#  

There are several DAGitty tutorials on youtube, one suggestion could be this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3euqrnD9w7c  

Read the “What if” book 

This is somewhat long read, but I really encourage you to take up the challenge. 
This book is a must read if you want to master the art of TTE. Read one chapter for breakfast each morning and you will soon be a TTE master.

Read PRINCIPLED 

The people behind the RCT-DUPLICATE initiative have made a great guide on how to use healthcare registry data and claims data (what we have available) to generate decision grade evidence using TTE. Their paper can be found here: https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-076460  

 

Trial Design 

Active comparator new user design (ACNU), or sequential nested trial design? 

If a clear time-zero is available for both the treatment and comparator arm - use the ACNU: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4486631/ 
If no clear time-zero exists for one of the arms - use sequential nested trial design.

Learn the statistical methods required 

I cannot state enough that the methods should be your last focus point. These methods will not be able to help you obtain causal estimates if your TTE design is flawed. 
Commonly used in TTE and causal inference are the g-methods and preferably in combination via targeted learning. Don’t worry which of these methods to use, just use targeted learning - this is the most optimal way of estimating your causal estimands. 

This stuff can feel overwhelming and complicated, but rest assured that you only need an intuitive understanding of how these methods work. Great implementations have already been made in R readily available for you to use. 

First get to understand inverse probability weighting and the g-formula. Then read about targeted learning and use that!
