##### Target Trial Emulation for Pharmaceutical and Research Innovation

I specialize in applied **target trial emulation**, **causal inference**, and **targeted learning** — rigorous methods for generating reliable evidence from real-world data. I work with research institutes and pharmaceutical companies to help integrate these approaches into research and development, ultimately supporting faster evidence generation and more evidence-based treatment strategies.

In addition to collaborative projects, **I offer practical workshops** in applied target trial emulation, designed to equip researchers, data scientists, and epidemiologists with the tools to apply causal inference methods in real-world settings.

**Interested in learning more or bringing a workshop to your team?** Feel free to reach out—I'd be happy to [connect](https://dk.linkedin.com/in/peter-bruun-rasmussen).
